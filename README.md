# A-Shell

**A-Shell** (short for *Amal-Shell / Advanced-Shell / Aura-Shell — take your pick*) is a continuation of my Linux shell project from my college days.

I recently came across this old code on one of my hard drives and decided to bring it back to life. Not out of boredom, but because revisiting old projects is a great way to experiment, learn, and productively kill some time while refining low-level concepts.
This project is a part of my old project named "ESOS" (Extented Support Operating System), which is discontinued due to lack of consistency and time. In the future, I'm planning to build a new, highly-customized OS.

## 🧠 Project Background

- Originally developed as a **college project**
- Intended to be implemented as part of a **custom operating system**
- Built to explore:
  - Process creation
  - Command parsing
  - Basic shell execution flow

This project is intentionally simple and educational, serving as a sandbox rather than a full-fledged shell.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** C  
- **Compiler:** GCC  
- **Platform:** Linux / Unix-like systems  

C is used for the basic setup and core shell logic. More advanced features and improvements may be added in the future as I continue playing around with it.

## 📦 Compilation

Compile the shell using:

```bash
gcc <shell_name> *.c
